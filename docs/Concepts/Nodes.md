# Nodes

A node is a Quorum Key Manager (QKM) component that interfaces with underlying node endpoints (such as an RPC node and Tessera node).

You can configure a node using a [node manifest](../HowTo/Use-Manifest-File.md#node-manifest).

Configure a node manfiest with an RPC node endpoint to [connect to the JSON-RPC node proxy](../Tutorials/JsonRPCProxy.md).
